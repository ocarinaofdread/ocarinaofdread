Hello! I'm ocarinaofdread, just some kid who wants to make video games.
I started programming when I was 7 on Scratch, and have since dabbled in JavaScript, Java, and C# in classes and on my own.

Here are some details about me:
- ðŸŽ® I love video games, believe it or not. My favorites are Zelda, Metroid, Mario, Ace Attorney, and Donkey Kong.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- ðŸŽ‰ Fun Fact: I won $500 from a NMSI competition with my Metroid Survival project.

ðŸ’» Favorite Projects: 
- Metroid Survival (code.org, JavaScript, 2022)
- Console Nonogram (code.org, Java, 2024)
- The Legend of Zelda: Call of the Elders (Unity, C#, 2024)
